# üöÄ Project Title
AI Specialist at your fingertips

# üìå Problem Statement
Problem Statement 1- Weave AI magic with Groq

# üéØ Objective
- Limited availability of specialized experts in many regions.
- Consultations are often expensive and not affordable for all.
- Waiting times slow down critical decision making and actions.
- AI Specialist is designed to offer precise, context-aware responses for professional tasks.

## üß† Team & Approach
### Team Name: RisingDevelopers
### Team Members: 
- Raunak (https://github.com/ThisIsAimer)
- Akriti (https://github.com/ThisIsAkriti)

## Your Approach:
- Planning and Setup:
   - Defined project scope: AI agents (DoctorAI, TeacherAI, LawyerAI) with text, image, and file processing using Groq API and RAG.
   - Initialized Next.js with TypeScript, installed Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Prisma, and Neon DB. Set up Cloudinary for file storage and Kinde for authentication.
- Authentication:
   - Integrated Kinde for secure user login/signup, configuring API routes and environment variables for session management.
- UI Development:
   - Built responsive UI with Shadcn components and Tailwind CSS, creating reusable components for agent selection, chat, and file uploads.
- AI Agent Integration:
   - Implemented Groq API for text-based agent responses, defining specialized system prompts for each agent (e.g., DoctorAI for medical queries).
   - Used Cloudinary to handle image/file uploads, as Groq API lacks file reading support.
- RAG Implementation:
   - Set up Prisma with Neon DB to store document embeddings for RAG, enabling context-aware responses by retrieving relevant data before generating answers with Groq.
- AI Avatar for Voice:
   - Developed a 3D AI avatar for DoctorAI using Three.js and vrm files for voice input/output, integrating with Groq for response generation.
- Testing and Refinement:
   - Tested agent functionality, file handling, and voice features. Fixed TypeScript errors and optimized API calls for performance.
